Style greetings with a hack

Used padding for gap, because using gap would mean
there would be spaces in all rows as well which we
don't want
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Your branch is based on 'origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
#   (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   index.html
#	modified:   style.css
