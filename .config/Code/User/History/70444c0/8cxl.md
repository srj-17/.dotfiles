- It's just a package manager to install the packages / dependencies for your current project
- npm is installed on the package.json file, which means that all the packages on that json file are installed
when you run npm install
- to individually install a package, you run `npm install <package-name>`
- to install a *scoped* package, you run `@scope
    - scoped package means that two organizations can have same package names
