# Encapsulation 
- What we did, bundling data, functions inside a unit, with seletive access to the things
inside of that unit 
- *We did this with objects*

# Moduling 
- We encapsulate the related data and methods into one *module* 
- You can say the module is the IIFE and object is the thing that IIFE gives out.
- That module gives us an object with the *same* name as *module*. 
- We use that object to call the functions / data (mostly functions) on that module.

- This leads to the concept called namespacing
- Namespace => creating different spaces for same names to remove ambiguity / collisions in our programs
