# Encapsulation 
- What we did, bundling data, functions inside a unit, with seletive access to the things
inside of that unit 
- *We did this with objects*

# Moduling 
- We encapsulate the related data and methods into one *module* 
- That module gives us an object with the *same* name as module. 
- We use that module
