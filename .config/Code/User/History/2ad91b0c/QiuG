Solve '.' press problem after memory operation

When operation was done and . was pressed, it was
stuck there until the next operation and in next number
press, it showed the number only.
eg: 8 + 3 = (shows 11) --> 11 in memory.accumulator
Now, if you pressed '.' before, it showed 11. and again
if you pressed 3, it showed only 3.
i.e. 11 . --> 11. 3 --> 3 
This happens because operation pachi displayBuffer hasn't
been refreshed to false. 
Solved by chaning the logic from inside 
if(numKeys.includes(press.target)) to outside it
