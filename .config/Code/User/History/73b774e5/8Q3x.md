- These are the properties that execute when you access the object properties.
- These properties are represented by getter and setter properties

Eg: 
```js
user = {
    name: "Saugat",
    get name() {
        return `hey, yer name is ${this.name}`;
    }
}
```

- They look like normal properties from outside, but are essentially the functions that are executed when getting or setting a value

> The main point is that we don't access them, they are executed behind the scenes

- eg: `user.name` executes the above name() getter
- setter works in similar way
