Convert form action to get

Would usually use "post" in most cases, but
use get here so as to not create an error when 
clicking submit => Create Account
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   index.html
