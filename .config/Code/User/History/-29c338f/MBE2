Make user.addTask() work using extra arrow funct.

Before, we were exporting addTodo as:
- { addTodo: }
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 6 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   src/index.js
#	modified:   src/project.js
#
