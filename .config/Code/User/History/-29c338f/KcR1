Make user.addTask() work using extra arrow funct.

Before, we were exporting addTodo as:
- { addTodo: directTodos.addTodo }, which means we
were exporting the direct reference to addTodo object.
- But exporting this means that access to the 
context (directTodos) is lost, 
- So, calling user.addTodo() wasn't recognizing the
function at all.
- Solution
